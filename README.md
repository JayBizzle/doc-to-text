This package provides a class to extract text from a Word Doc.

```php
<?php

use Jaybizzle\DocToText\Doc;

echo Doc::getText('book.doc'); // returns the text from the doc
```

## Requirements

Behind the scenes this package leverages [antiword](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiword). You can verify if the binary is installed on your system by issuing this command:

```bash
which antiword
```

If it is installed it will return the path to the binary.

To install the binary you can use this command on Ubuntu or Debian:

```bash
apt-get install antiword
```

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require jaybizzle/doc-to-text
```

## Usage

Extracting text from a Doc is easy.

```php
$text = (new Doc())
    ->setDoc('book.doc')
    ->text();
```

Or easier:

```php
echo Doc::getText('book.doc');
```

By default the package will assume that the `antiword` command is located at `/usr/bin/antiword`.
If it is located elsewhere pass its binary path to the constructor

```php
$text = (new Doc('/custom/path/to/antiword'))
    ->setDoc('book.doc')
    ->text();
```

or as the second parameter to the `getText` static method:

```php
echo Doc::getText('book.doc', '/custom/path/to/antiword');
```

Sometimes you may want to use [antiword options](https://linux.die.net/man/1/antiword). To do so you can set them up using the `setOptions` method.

```php
$text = (new Doc())
    ->setDoc('table.doc')
    ->setOptions(['f', 'w 80'])
    ->text()
;
```

or as the third parameter to the `getText` static method:

```php
echo Doc::getText('book.doc', null, ['f', 'w 80']);
```
